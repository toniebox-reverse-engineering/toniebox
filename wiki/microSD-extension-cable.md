# SD card extension
For convenience a SD extension cable can be used to place the card in a better accessible way. A 25 cm cable is recommend.

You can use both types of cables:

* microSD card – microSD card
* microSD card – SD card

## Tools needed:
- Philips (PH0) and flat screwdrivers
- flat screwdriver
- soldering station or cutter
- double sided foam tape (made for outside use since they are the strongest)
- cutting pliers
- extension cable - minimum 25 cm long 

## Step 1: Preparing the extension cable

- Remove the plastic casing of the female end of the cable (where the card has to be inserted)
- Remove one resistor on the slot's PCB (marked in red) using either a soldering station or a cutter (more risky)

- Cut the corners of the PCB. Do not cut more than the holes allow as there are electrical traces nearby.

## Step 2: Open the Toniebox

I won't go into too many details at this step. I believe the following Youtube videos will give all the needed info: https://youtu.be/GOZRjaEhrcQ & https://youtu.be/eiMxkXM8YDs
In order to avoid damaging the PCB, disconnect the battery.

## Step 3: Connecting the extension cable to the mainboard

This part might be a bit tricky on older boards since these ones have a capacitor that sits a few mm in front of the microSD slot.

Because the male end of the extension cable is not flexible, inserting it in the microSD slot is a matter of force. Before inserting the extension cable it is advisable to check the position of the latch in open and closed state, in order to get a feeling about how much it has to be pushed.

- Open the slot by pushing it towards the capacitor
- Take the original card out and replace it with the extension cable
- Close the microSD slot and simultaneously press with one finger on the latch while locking it into place with a flat screwdriver or a fingernail.

## Step 4: Glue the new microSD slot in an accessible place

- Take as much tape as you feel comfortable (I could have probably added double as much) and stick one side to the cable's microSD slot.
- Glue the slot between the two screw holes on the battery holder, making sure that it sits as close to the edge as possible.

## Alternative Step 4: Make the card slot more accesible

- In order to make the slot reach the very edge of the battery holder, some have cut two small slits into the walls of the screw guides. I wanted to keep my box 100% original so I skipped this step.

## Step 5: Start putting the box back

- Start by twisting the extension cable in such a way that it could stay between the PCB and the battery holder.
- Screw together the battery holder, the board and the white holder. 
- Make sure the cable sits comfortably under the battery holder

- Power on the box and test that the box recognizes the microSD card
Make sure to never touch the battery release latch, as this will partially detach the microSD slot.

Step 6: Finish putting the box back and test again

- Just make sure that the microSD card is reachable with a set of tweezers and you can comfortably remove and put back the card. Be careful not to drop the card inside the box.
